# Image Sizer

# Sooz (Suzanne) Richman - FavoredFortune

# Overview
This application allows users to upload photos and request different sizes of the photo back.

# Current Status
Tues October 16 1:21 PM PT - error view isn't routing correctly , firebase still not installed locally to test photo calls.

# User Story
As a photojournalist, I want to be able to upload my large format JPG images to a database for others to access. I also want the others who want to use my images to be able to choose what dimensions they get the photo downloaded in.

# Instructions for use/review
- After cloning/forking the repository, please download all dependencies by typing npm i in the command line of your terminal interface within the project folder.
- You can then launch the server back end in the terminal with the command 
`node server.js` (this shows the server at localhost:3000)
- To see the front end interface, from the same folder in the terminal type in live-server (this shows the front end at localhost:8080/)
